I ran across a video recently that was taking up almost 2 GB of space in my library. I played it back to find that my toddler (at the time) had captured an hour-long video, but had left the tablet on the ground the entire time, camera facing down.\nThe entire video was black, but the audio was pretty adorable. I wanted to keep the audio, but hated that it was taking up so much space. Fortunately, I’ve used ffmpeg enough to know that I can strip streams out of a media file like this.\nIn this post, I’ll walk you through how I accomplished this. I’ll show you how I was able to:\nRemove the video, since I know it was all black. Keep the audio. Keep all the metadata from the original file (e.g. creation_time). Let’s start by figuring out what streams are in the file. We’ll use ffprobe, which gathers information from multimedia streams and prints it in human- and machine-readable fashion1.\nffprobe 20140716_071935.mp4 I won’t include the entire output, because it’s fairly verbose. Instead, I’ll skip down to the section that describes the input.\nInput #0, mov,mp4,m4a,3gp,3g2,mj2, from '20140716_071935.mp4': Metadata: major_brand : isom minor_version : 0 compatible_brands: isom3gp4 creation_time : 2014-07-16T12:17:10.000000Z Duration: 00:57:32.52, start: 0.000000, bitrate: 4743 kb/s Stream #0:0[0x1](eng): Video: h264 (High) (avc1 / 0x31637661), yuv420p(progressive), 1280x720, 4615 kb/s, 29.91 fps, 29.92 tbr, 90k tbn (default) Metadata: creation_time : 2014-07-16T12:17:10.000000Z handler_name : VideoHandle vendor_id : [0][0][0][0] encoder : Stream #0:1[0x2](eng): Audio: aac (LC) (mp4a / 0x6134706D), 48000 Hz, stereo, fltp, 123 kb/s ( default) Metadata: creation_time : 2014-07-16T12:17:10.000000Z handler_name : SoundHandle vendor_id : [0][0][0][0] We can see that the file has one audio stream (Stream #0:1[0x2](eng): Audio) and one video stream (Stream #0:0[0x1](eng): Video).\nI want to remove the video stream since I know it’s all black. This will result in a much smaller file. I want to keep the audio stream as well as all the metadata (e.g. creation_time). The command below will do exactly that.\nffmpeg \\ # Path to the input file. -i 20140716_071935.mp4 \\ # Copy all streams without re-encoding. -codec copy \\ # Copy all the streams. -map 0 \\ # Omit the video stream. -map -0:v:0 \\ # Copy the global metadata. -map_metadata 0 \\ # Copy the audio stream's metadata. -map_metadata:s:a 0:s:a \\ # Add some custom metadata. -metadata comment=\"Removed video stream because it was all black.\" \\ # Path to the output file. 20140716_071935-audio-only.mp4 Let’s use ffprobe to confirm the metadata and audio stream were copied to the output file.\nffprobe 20140716_071935-audio-only.mp4 Again, I’m omitting some of the verbose output at the beginning.\nInput #0, mov,mp4,m4a,3gp,3g2,mj2, from '20140716_071935-audio-only.mp4': Metadata: major_brand : isom minor_version : 512 compatible_brands: isomiso2mp41 creation_time : 2014-07-16T12:17:10.000000Z encoder : Lavf59.27.100 comment : Removed video stream because it was all black.

There’s only one stream, an audio stream, and we added our comment metadata.\nNow, let’s check the file size.\n-rw-r--r-- 1 blachniet staff 51M Jan 16 15:03 20140716_071935-audio-only.mp4 -rw-r--r--@ 1 blachniet staff 1.9G Dec 18 07:30 20140716_071935.mp4 Wow!
