Having trouble deciding whether to use a `div`, `section` or `article` in your HTML5 page? [Oli Studholme](http://oli.jp/) has a great article explaining how they should be used and provides a very simple method for deciding which to use.

> To decide which of these three elements is appropriate, choose the first suitable option:

> 3\. Finally if there’s no semantic relationship use <div>
