I've decided to shut down the Rager service at the end of October. I haven't had time to improve or maintain the service lately. Some recent outages have gone unresolved for weeks!

I suggest that those who were using this service consider [Libraries.io](https://libraries.io/) as an alternative. Libraries.io has:

- Support  for many [project repositories and package managers](https://libraries.io/platforms)
- [Many features](https://libraries.io/about)
- [A team supporting the project](https://libraries.io/team)
- Corporate sponsorship
- It's [open source](https://github.com/librariesio)!
