As the title suggests, the goal of this site is not entirely ironed out. I'm actually trying to think of goals as I write this now, so lets start out with a simple introduction. I am a Computer Science graduate from Virginia Tech, class of 2009, with a minor in Mathematics. Since graduation I have worked on client-side gaming machines at Video Gaming Technologies, Inc. near Charlottesville, VA. While at VGT I have had the opportunity to expand my technical experience in both C# and C++, as well as get my feet wet in a few other languages including Python and ActionScript.

Now that I have lost the interest of one of the two readers whose eyes will ever caress these words, here's my current list of goals for this site:

- Provide myself with a platform for sharing/showing off some of my work.
- Provide readers with some helpful tips, tricks and tutorials in whatever technology I happen to be working in.
- Promote myself as a developer.
- Prove _P = NP_

That last one might be a little ambitious, but a nerd can dream. Hopefully I'll be able to achieve most of these, but I'm counting on that one guy that's still reading to let me know when I don't.
