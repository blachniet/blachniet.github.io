      <description>Last month I gave a presentation on using Serilog, Elasticsearch and Kibana for logging from an application. You can see the slides from that presentation below. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of success with this trio lately. It has provided a lot of details about what is going on in my application that would have been more difficult to obtain before.</description>

      <description>ThoughtWorks recently released their Technology Radar report for January 2015 and structured logging was among the techniques that they strongly suggested that the industry adopt. I&amp;rsquo;ve actually had some exposure to structured logging over the past year and have been very happy with the results. So, I thought I would share my experience.
My first exposure to structured logging was in early 2014. I was creating a simple Python application to monitor the amount traffic through my modem throughout the day and I was logging events from my application to logentries.</description>
