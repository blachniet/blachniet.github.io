      <description>Restic is a wonderfully simple backup program. I&amp;rsquo;ve used it on my Linux machines for a while. I recently decided to use it on macOS as well.
restic --repo /Volumes/restic-repo --verbose backup ~/Documents ~/Pictures If you run this on macOS, you might get an error like the following from restic. The error indicates that restic can&amp;rsquo;t open the Photos library folder.
can not obtain extended attribute com.apple.fileprovider.ignore#P for /Users/blachniet/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary: can not obtain extended attribute com.</description>

      <description>A leaf in Homebrew is a formula that is not a dependency of another installed formula. You can list the currently installed leaves using the brew leaves command. See thoughtbot&amp;rsquo;s brew leaves post for more information on this command.
Removing a leaf in Homebrew can suddenly introduce many more leaves; the dependencies of the formula you removed. In this post I will show you how to remove a leaf as well as all its dependencies not used by any other formulae.</description>
