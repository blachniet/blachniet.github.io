      <title>Email Addresses as User Names in ASP.NET Identity</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s common for web applications to use email addresses instead of user names to distinguish users. However, if you are using ASP.NET Identity, you have probably noticed that it has UserName built into the IUser interface. Since Identity assumes that this is the distinguishing field for the user, it&amp;rsquo;s not crazy to think that it might be a good place to drop the email address. In order to have Identity allow an email address in this field, you will need to write a custom IIdentityValidator.</description>

      <title>Email Address in MVC 5 Google Authentication</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not proud to admit that I spent hours trying to figure out this very simple problem. The goal was simple: when a user logs into my web application using Google authentication, I want to be able to grab their email address so I can store it as part of their user profile. As expected, this is very simple.
I&amp;rsquo;m assuming you&amp;rsquo;ve already enabled Google authentication by uncommenting app.UseGoogleAuthentication() in your Startup.</description>

      <description>In my recent exploration of web development in ASP.NET, I found what I assume to be a fairly common need to have part of a view/page update without the entire page updating. In my particular case, I wanted to have a page that listed items but also provided a form that allowed you to add an item. When an item was added, the list of items would be updated without having to regenerate the entire page.</description>
